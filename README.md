========

An IRC bot that, once given the chance, will take control of a channel.

Will sit in channel until it receives op or admin (waits for admin if someone
else in channel has admin), and it will then de op/admin everyone else, and 
work to maintain that control, while mocking/kicking/making demands of everyone
else in channel
